# FCC Launchpad: A Solana launchpad focused on security, reliability, and speed 

The Fat Cats Capital Launchpad is a world class Solana NFT launchpad designed to help launch nft collections and ensure a flawless mint day for new projects. It is built on top of Metaplex's Candy Machine V2 (used for majority of Solana NFTs) and retains all of the functionality of CMV2 plus much more. CMV3 support will be added after more solana projects use it and it has a proven security track record just like CMV2 does today.

# Security

The FCC Launchpad has been built with a security first mindset using the best technology available today. The core source code of the launchpad has had a full security audit completed by top security researches at OtterSec. The contents of that audit can be viewed here : https://docsend.com/view/is7963h8tbbvp2g9. There were no Major findings and 5 out of the 6 low priority findings have since been fixed and fixes deployed by the FCC development team/author's of this launchpad. Having launchpad's audited is not a standard practice in this industry because of the high associated cost. However, having the FCC launchpad was a no-brainer as we wanted every user of this launchpad to have no doubts about the superior security provided by using a highly reviewed, well tested, and highly secure launchpad.

# Speed

Given that multiple studies have demonstrated that site speed affects conversion rate, the FCC launchpad has been designed and architected to be as fast as possible using the latest and greatest techonolgies available today. The launchpad code has been developed using a minimalist approach while still being optimized to make for a lightning fast production website environment.

# Reliability

The FCC launchpad is highly fault tolerant, and is built with an architecture that has an extremely low chance of downtime even during peak traffic. It can easily handle millions of concurrent users with no issues and has built in security mechanisms to defend against DDOS and other sophisticated attacks. It has many built in protection mechinisms against pervasive bot traffic including a web access firewall and dedicated fallback RPCs
